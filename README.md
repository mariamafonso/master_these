**Research areas:** Robotics and Computational Intelligence

**Theme:** Application of Collaborative SLAM to Intelligent Wheelchairs


This work proposes a system to support the collaborative mapping among intelligent wheelchairs. To the best of our knowledge, only the traditional SLAM was employed to intelligent wheelchairs until now. In other words, IWs capable of mapping perform it individually, and they do not share the resulting knowledge with other intelligent devices.
